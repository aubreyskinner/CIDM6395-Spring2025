## Introduction
This assessment provides a comprehensive evaluation of my knowledge in Data Analytics. I will examine areas where I am proficient, areas needing improvement, and gaps in my capabilities that I hope to fill. Supporting evidence, including examples of my previous work and resources I have utilized, will reinforce this evaluation. Furthermore, I will assess how Data Analytics integrates with broader domains and explore its practical applications. Throughout my education, I have developed a strong foundation in various techniques, tools, and methodologies, and this assessment serves as an opportunity to reflect on my progress.
